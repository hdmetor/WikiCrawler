This is a basic crawler for Wikipedia articles.
Please don't use it to actively crawl it at runtime. And if you need to, remember to [follow thir rules](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#Please_do_not_use_a_web_crawler):

Note that I filter out external, disambiguation and other links (e.g. images).

Still work in progress


####Possible improvment:


* pass the as arguments to the script the following variables:

  - file location
  - start page
  - length

* speed improvements: hash the pages for a quicker search
