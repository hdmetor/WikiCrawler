This is a basic crawler for Wikipedia articles.

I filter out external, disambiguation and other links (e.g. images).

I wanted an interesting dataset so I decided to create my own.

Still work in progress


###TODOS:


* pass the as arguments to the script the following variables:

  - file location
  - start page
  - length

* speed improvements: hash the pages for a quicker search

* move helper function to a module
